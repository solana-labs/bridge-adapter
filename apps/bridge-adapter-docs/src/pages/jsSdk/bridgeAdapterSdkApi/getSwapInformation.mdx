# Getting the routes for a source-target token pair

## Usage

```typescript
const swapRoutes = await sdk.getSwapInformation({
    ...sourceToken,
    // contrived
    selectedAmountInBaseUnits: "1000000";
    selectedAmountFormatted: "1";
  },
  targetToken
);

console.log("swapRoutes", swapRoutes);
```

## Return Type

The `swapRotes` variables is an array of `SwapInformation`.

```typescript
// Note the various token types all have the expected info, such as decimals, symbol, names etc.
// They vary only in the extra params that is specific to the token type.
export type SwapInformation = {
  sourceToken: TokenWithAmount;
  targetToken: TokenWithExpectedOutput;
  bridgeName: string;
  tradeDetails: {
    fee: FeeToken[];
    priceImpact: number;
    estimatedTimeMinutes: number;
    routeInformation: {
      fromTokenSymbol: string;
      toTokenSymbol: string;
    }[];
  };
};

swapRoutes: SwapInformation[];
```

## Notes on `1.0.0` release

Today, one can only specify the amount of input token that they are willing to pay. The SDK will return the various possible target token values for that amount.

In the future, we will add support for specifying the amount of target token that one wants to receive. This will allow the SDK to return the routes with amount of source token that is needed to achieve such an output amount.

Note that I am also considering renaming `SwapInformation` to `SwapRoute` to be more consistent with the meaning of things.
