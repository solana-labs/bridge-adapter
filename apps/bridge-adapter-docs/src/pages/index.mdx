# Unified Bridge Adapter SDK

## Problem

<div
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    paddingTop: "1.5rem",
  }}
>
  <Image

    alt="TVL of chains today"
    width={500}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

Today's liquidity is highly fragmented. With more chains popping up than ever, it is increasingly hard for a developer to ensure that the incoming user will have the necessary funds needed to interact with the protocol or application.

Additional work has to be taken to provide instructions on how to bridge assets over. Or in the case of the ambitious developer, integrate a bridge with obscure tokens that have little liquidity.

## Solution

The unified bridge adapter SDK solves the challenge of having an increasing number of chains and growing liquidity fragmentation in two ways. By leveraging existing bridge infrastructure to go cross-chain, and by leveraging existing DEXes to increase the total pool of tokens that can be used with these bridge infrastructure.

### Unifying Existing Bridges

The unified bridge adapter SDK provides a unified framework for interacting with all the various bridges out there. Instead of having to integrate each bridge 1 by 1, a developer simply needs to integrate this sdk to get the benefit of integrating multiple bridges.

### Leveraging Existing Decentralzed Exchanges (DEXes)

While leveraging various existing bridges allows us to move more seamlessly between chains, we also leverage existing DEXes to increase the total pool of tokens that can be taken cross chain.

Developers simply integrate a single SDK and get the combined benefits of the existing bridges and DEXes that exists today.

### What this looks like today

Below is a demo of what you can enable as a developer with minimal code.
