# `BridgeModalProvider`

The `BridgeModalProvider` is used to hold the values that would be used to instantiate the underlying `BridgeSdk`.

We _don't_ currently expose the underlyingn `BridgeSdk` via a hook. If this is something that you need, let us know. The way I think about it, you'd just use the underlying core sdk directly instead.

## Usage

```tsx
import { BridgeModalProvider } from "@elasticbottle/react-bridge-adapter-sdk";

<BridgeModalProvider
  bridgeAdapterSetting={{
    allow: ["deBridge", "wormhole"],
  }}
  settings={{
    evm: {
      alchemyApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY ?? "",
      infuraApiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID ?? "",
    },
    solana: {
      solanaRpcUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL ?? "",
    },
  }}
  sourceChain="Ethereum"
  targetChain="Solana"
>
  <BridgeModal>
    <Button>Subscribe</Button>
  </BridgeModal>
</BridgeModalProvider>;
```

## Configurations
