# Getting supported tokens

This function returns the list of tokens that is available for swapping and bridging across all the bridges and DEXes.

## Usage

```typescript
// getting tokens to swap from
const sourceTokens = await sdk.getSupportedTokens(
  "source",
  {
    sourceChain,
    targetChain, //optional
  },
  // this is optional
  {
    sourceToken,
    targetToken,
  }
);
console.log("sourceTokens", sourceTokens);

// getting tokens to swap to
const targetTokens = await sdk.getSupportedTokens(
  "target",
  {
    sourceChain, //optional
    targetChain,
  },
  // this is optional
  {
    sourceToken,
    targetToken,
  }
);
console.log("targetTokens", targetTokens);
```

## Return Type

The return type is an array of `Token` objects. The `Token` object is defined as follows:

```typescript
export type Token = {
  logoUri: string;
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  address: string;
  decimals: number;
  chain: ChainName;
  bridgeNames: Bridges[];
};
```

## Notes on `1.0.0` release

The current API for `getSupportedTokens` is not final. There is some inherent clunkiness with needing to decide what you need to provide. Part of this in in part because some bridge require a strict 1 to 1 correspondance between the source and target tokens. We are working on lifting this restriction and will be updating the API in the future to reflect this.
