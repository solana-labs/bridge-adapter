# Bridging or Swapping the Assets

This function will take in a `SwapInformation` after you [chose the route](/getSwapInformation.mdx) and initiate the bridging of the assets. It will return `true` if the bridging was successful. If it was not successful, this function _will throw_ and you can see the error in the console.

## Usage

```typescript
const isSuccess = sdk.bridge({
  sourceAccount,
  targetAccount,
  swapsInformation[0], // this is from sdk.getSwapInformation above
  onStatusUpdate,
});
```

## Notes on `1.0.0` release

Currently, I don't do a very good job of handling errors. In the future, I will be adding better error handling. For now, you can see the errors in the console and is thrown when something goes wrong.
