# Getting supported chains

This function returns the list of chains supported by all the bridges that is being used under the hood.

## Usage

```typescript
const chains = await sdk.getSupportedChains(); // ['Ethereum', 'Avalanche', 'Solana', ...]
```

## Currently supported chains

The `chains` variable returned is of type `ChainName[]`, which correspond to one of the following chain names:

```javascript
export const CHAIN_NAMES = [
    "Ethereum",
    "Solana",
    "Polygon",
    "Avalanche",
    "Arbitrum",
    "Optimism",
"BSC",
] as const;

export type ChainName = typeof CHAIN_NAMES[number];
```

## Notes on `1.0.0` release

Future release might consider returning an `object` containing other information about the chain that might be considered useful in the DX context of integrating this list with a front-end
