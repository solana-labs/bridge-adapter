This page goes over some quick basic terminology that might be usefull.

## `Source` and `Target`

`Source` refers to what the user starts on. We use terms like `source token`, `source chain` etc. freely

`Target` refers to where the user wants to end up in. We use terms like `target token`, `target chain` etc. freely

Note that `Source` and `Target` might well be the same chain or token.

## `Accounts` and `Wallets` and `Signers`

All these refers to an owner who has the ability to sign for a transaction. For the most part we use terms like `source account`, `target account` etc. freely.

Due to the proliferation of various packages in the space, we might inevitably refer to these `accounts` as `wallets` or `signers`, but know that they are referring to the same thing unless explicitly stated otherwise.
