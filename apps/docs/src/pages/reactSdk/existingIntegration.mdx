This page is for you if you currently are integrated with one of the following SDKs and looking to use this SDK:

- `wagmi`
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`

If so, then you are in the right place.

## Integrating with `wagmi`

The only thing you have to do when integrating with `wagmi` is to omit the `EvmWalletProvider`. This is because in using `wagmi`, you already wrap your app in a `wagmi` client which is what `EvmWalletProvider` uses under the hood.

## Inegrating with `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`

Similarly, for integrating with `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, you have to omit the `SolanaWalletProvider`. This is because in using `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` you already wrap your app in a `WalletProvider` which is what `SolanaWalletProvider` uses under the hood.
