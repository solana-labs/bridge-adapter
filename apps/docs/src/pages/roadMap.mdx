# Road map to `1.0.0`

While this package is new, I believe that there is a huge need for something like this and am continuing to work on this as part of something closely tied to my day job.

While I do not recommend this in production just yet, I welcome any brave souls who do tinker to [reach out](https://github.com/ElasticBottle/bridge-adapter-sdk/issues)

As the product is currently undergoing heavy development, I welcome any and all feedback in the following areas:

- API
- Documentation
- Package structure

Moreover, you will on occasion notice various reference to notes on what might change in the future for `1.0.0` and beyond. These are _not_ set in stone and is subject to change. I also welcome other suggestions outside or going against what I wrote.
